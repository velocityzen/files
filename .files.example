# .files configuration example
# Place this file as .files in either the left or right directory.
# Right directory values override left directory values.
# CLI flags override all .files settings.
# Use --no-config to disable .files loading.

# Fuzzy filename matching threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
# 1.0 = exact matches only, lower values allow fuzzy matching
# based on Levenshtein distance
# matchPrecision = 0.8

# File size difference tolerance for fuzzy-matched files (0.0 to 1.0)
# 0.0 = exact content comparison
# Higher values allow more size difference (e.g., 0.2 = 20%)
# Only applies to fuzzy-matched pairs (matchPrecision < 1.0)
# sizeTolerance = 0.2

# Scan subdirectories recursively (true/false)
# recursive = true

# Delete files in destination that don't exist in source
# One-way sync only
# deletions = false

# Scan leaf directories on the right side for additional diff information
# One-way sync without deletions only
# showMoreRight = false

# Preview changes without applying them (true/false)
# dryRun = false

# Show detailed output with all operations (true/false)
# verbose = false

# Output format: text, json, summary
# format = text

# Enable two-way sync (true/false)
# twoWay = false

# Conflict resolution strategy for two-way sync:
# newest, left, right, skip
# conflictResolution = newest

# Disable .filesignore pattern matching (true/false)
# noIgnore = false

# Boolean values accept: true/false, yes/no, 1/0
