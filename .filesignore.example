# .filesignore - Example file ignore patterns
# Similar to .gitignore syntax
#
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Blank lines are ignored
#
# Patterns:
#   * matches any characters except /
#   ? matches a single character except /
#   ** matches zero or more directories
#   / at start means pattern is relative to root
#   / at end means pattern matches directories only
#   ! negates a pattern (include files that were previously excluded)
